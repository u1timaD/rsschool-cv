## **About Me**
I worked as a screenwriter and editing director for a long time, but realized that I enjoyed solving a different type of problems, which led me to find myself in frontend development. I have a full set of soft skills and love learning, constantly developing, and can`t sleep until a task is solved. My main goal is to become an excellent frontend developer who can bring big profits to an employer with my solutions.
